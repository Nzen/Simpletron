(testing multiple files)
	Shit, multiple files requires OS help because all these
	hardcoded addresses foul up execution expectations
	that is not encapsulated at all. Oh well.
	I'm adding 7 to everything

	User specified, decrementing while loop prints its index
go past vars to 10
(loop limit spot)
(decrement spot)
get user loop limit
store at 1
load 2
subtract decrement
print Acc
goto 10 if zero
goto 6 (subtract) since the other one failed
stop

	STOP = 0
	READ = 10
	WRITE = 11
	ADD = 20
	SUBTR = 21
	MULTP = 22
	DIVIDE = 23
	GOTO = 30
	GOTOZERO = 31
	GOTONEG = 32
	LOAD = 40
	STORE = 41
