(testing multiple files)
	Shit, multiple files requires OS help because all these
	hardcoded addresses foul up execution expectations
	that is not encapsulated at all. Oh well.
	I'm adding 7 to everything

	User specified, decrementing while loop prints its index
go past vars to 11
(loop limit spot)
(decrement spot)
get user loop limit, put in 9
load from 9
subtract decrement at 10
store at 9
print from 9
goto 1 if zero
goto 6 (subtract) since the other one failed
stop

	STOP = 0
	READ = 10
	WRITE = 11
	ADD = 20
	SUBTR = 21
	MULTP = 22
	DIVIDE = 23
	GOTO = 30
	GOTOZERO = 31
	GOTONEG = 32
	LOAD = 40
	STORE = 41
