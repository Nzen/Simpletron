goto 4 if acc = 0 (it is)
# 12
# 13
# space for result
put val at 1 (12) in acc
add acc & val at 2
store in 3
print (from 3)
stop

Works, but relies on direct addressing for the moment.
Remove stop to test multiple (sequential) processes

	STOP = 0 # 43
	READ = 10 # same
	WRITE = 11 # same
	ADD_I = 20 # 30
	SUB_I = 21 # 31
	MUL_I = 22 # 33
	DIV_I = 23 # 32
	GOTO = 30 # 40
	GO_ZERO = 31 # 42
	GO_NEG = 32 # 41
	LOAD = 40 # 20
	STORE = 41 # 21
