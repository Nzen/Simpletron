(testing multiple files)
	Shit, multiple files requires OS help because all these
	hardcoded addresses foul up execution expectations
	that is not encapsulated at all. Oh well.
	I'm adding 7 to everything

	User specified, decrementing while loop prints its index
go past vars to 11
(loop limit spot)
(decrement spot)
get user loop limit, put in 9
load from 9
subtract decrement at 10
store at 9
print from 9
goto 1 if zero
goto 6 (subtract) since the other one failed
stop

	STOP = 0 # 43
	READ = 10 # same
	WRITE = 11 # same
	ADD_I = 20 # 30
	SUB_I = 21 # 31
	MUL_I = 22 # 33
	DIV_I = 23 # 32
	GOTO = 30 # 40
	GO_ZERO = 31 # 42
	GO_NEG = 32 # 41
	LOAD = 40 # 20
	STORE = 41 # 21
